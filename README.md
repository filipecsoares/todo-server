# Rust TODO List Project

This project is a web application created to manage a TODO list. It was developed in Rust for educational purposes, based on the material from the online book [Web Development with Rust](https://naomijub.github.io/web-dev-rust-book).

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the Rust programming language and several of its libraries for web development, including:

- **Rocket**: A web framework for Rust that makes it simple to write fast, secure, and reliable web applications.
- **Diesel**: A safe, extensible ORM and Query Builder for Rust.
- **Tera**: A template engine inspired by Jinja2 and Django Templates.
